Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from  Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.   B. New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   ""13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby  agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.""

Amendment To the Commercial License

A. Section 5.9 of the Commercial License is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:

""Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.""

Nothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber's obligations to replace MCC-17 and Bioamber's current E. coli strain with CB1 in all the  existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees, according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the  Commercial License.      * Confidential treatment requested

(""FIIOC""); New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (""Company"")",01-01-1998,01-01-1998,,,,Massachusetts,No,No,"Exhibit (8)(k)(k)

SERVICE AGREEMENT

This Agreement is entered into and effective as of the 1st day of January, 1998, by and between FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC. (""FIIOC"") and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION (""Company"").

WHEREAS, FIIOC provides transfer agency and other services to Fidelity's Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III (collectively ""Funds""); and

WHEREAS, the services provided by FIIOC on behalf of the Funds include responding to inquiries about the Funds including the provision of information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, etc.; and

WHEREAS, Company holds shares of the Funds in order to fund certain variable annuity contracts, group annuity contracts, and/or variable life insurance policies, the beneficial interests in which are held by individuals, plan trustees, or others who look to Company to provide information about the Funds similar to the information provided by FIIOC; and

WHEREAS, the Company and one or more of the Funds have entered into one or more Participation Agreements, under which the Company agrees not to provide information about the Funds except for information provided by the Funds or their designees; and

WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company desire that Company be able to respond to inquiries about the Funds from individual variable annuity owners, participants in group annuity contracts issued by the Company, and owners and participants under variable life insurance policies issued by the Company, and prospective customers for any of the above; and

WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company recognize that Company's efforts in responding to customer inquiries will reduce the burden that such inquiries would place on FIIOC should such inquiries be directed to FIIOC.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows:

1. Information to be Provided to Company. FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds.

2. Use of Information by Company. Company may use the information provided by FIIOC in communications to individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC may





need to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company.

3. Compensation to Company. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:

At the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.

Should any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ].

4. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Company at any time upon written notice to FIIOC. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder.

5. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted under and in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

6. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that it shall be assigned automatically to any successor to FIIOC as the Funds' transfer agent, and any such successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have set their hands as of the date first written above.

(""mPhase"")(""a Party"" and collectively, ""the Parties"")",1/21/03,,1/21/04,successive 1 year,,New York,No,No,"EXHIBIT 10.15

CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT

This Agreement is made this 21st day of January 2003 by and between Lucent Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation having a principal place of business at 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 (""Lucent"") and mPhase Technologies Inc., a New Jersey corporation located at 587 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 068545 (""mPhase"") (each individually, ""a Party"" and, collectively, ""the Parties""}.

WHEREAS, mPhase wishes to use the Lucent Technologies name and Logo and the slogan TECHNOLOGY BY LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES on printed circuit boards, product packaging and in printed marketing materials (""Approved Uses"") in connection with its multi-access product (the ""Goods"") and Lucent wishes to permit mPhase to do so.

NOW THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows:

1.       mPhase may apply only the exact logo shown on Schedule A of this          Agreement (the ""Lucent Co-Branding Logo""} in Approved Uses for mPhase's          Goods.

2.       mPhase agrees to abide by the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of          this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and          specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent          Co-Branding Logo. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be          updated from time to time and agrees to abide by those updates as well          as the guidelines provided herein.

3.       In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the          sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the          mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written          notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.

4.       mPhase agrees that it acquires no rights to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo          nor to the marks LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING          DESIGN, by its use and that any use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo by          mPhase inures to the benefit of Lucent.

5.       mPhase agrees not to adopt any designation which is confusingly similar          to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or Lucent's marks LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN. Any attempt to do so          shall be a breach of this Agreement and Lucent may terminate this          Agreement without notice in the event of such a breach.

6.       This Agreement shall terminate in the event of a significant change in          the management or ownership of mPhase or in the event mPhase is the          subject of any bankruptcy proceedings.

7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.          mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current          quality of their Goods.

8.       If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at          the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in          writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

9.       mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo, to ensure that those uses reviewed and          approved pursuant to the procedure set forth in Schedule B continue to          be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

10.      In the event that mPhase becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo or other Lucent marks by third parties, mPhase          agrees to promptly notify Lucent and to cooperate fully, at Lucent's          expense, in any enforcement of Lucent's rights against such third

parties. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to          require Lucent to enforce any rights against third parties or to          restrict Lucent's rights to license or consent to such third parties'          use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or any other Lucent marks.

11.      The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall          continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to          annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual          expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent          shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate          the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least          thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.

12.      Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase shall immediately cease use          of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, provided, however, that mPhase shall          have no obligation to remove such Co-Branding Logo from any Goods sold          prior to the date of such termination.

13.      Neither Party shall be liable to the other for special, incidental, or          consequential damages, even if such Party has been advised of the          possibility of such damages.

14.      This Agreement shall not be assigned by mPhase without the prior          written consent of Lucent.

15.      The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be          governed by the laws of the State of New York.

16.      This Agreement, including the Schedules and Addenda hereto, constitutes          the entire Agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter          hereof and supersedes all proposals, oral or written, all negotiations,          conversations, and/or discussions between the Parties relating to this          Agreement and all past courses of dealing or industry customs.

Co-Branding Guidelines

Control Specifications

o  Consistent with our guidelines, 'Bell Labs Innovations' from the Lucent Logo    can never appear on co-branded offers.

o  The 2-logos of each company can never be combined to form a compositE logo    or suggest the ""two company's"" are part of one company.

o  Our Logo must always maintain a staging of 1/2 the diameter of the Innovation    Ring of clearspace.

o  The Lucent Logo may be reproduced in black or with the Innovation Ring in    Lucent Red with black type.

o  The Lucent co-branding Art shown in Schedule A above may not be altered in    any way from the form in which it is provided to mPhase by Lucent    Technologies.

o  Since our mark is prominent, it is important that a form of each new or    initial use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo be reviewed individually prior to    implementation. Although mPhase may receive Co-branding approval for one    application, it has not been granted 'blanket use' of the Co-Branding Logo or    the Lucent Marks on all other applications.

o  Samples of each new or initial use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo should be    sent to Corporate Identity, Lucent Technologies, Attn: Bob Cort, Room 3A 405,    600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ 07974-0636; and to Lucent Technologies    Inc., Attn: Trademarks & Copyrights, Room 2F 181, 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray    Hill, NJ 07974-0636 for approval prior to any use of the materials.

                          FIRST AMENDMENT TO SAGEBRUSH                       MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT

     THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO SAGEBRUSH MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT (""Amendment"") is made and entered into as of December 1, 1990 by and among Sagebrush, a California general partnership (""Partnership""), the undersigned partners of the Partnership, being all of the Sagebrush partners (""Partners""), and ToyoWest Management Inc., a California corporation (""Manager""), with respect to the following facts and circumstances:

                                 R E C I T A L S                                  ---------------

     A.  The Partnership, all of the Partners except Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime) Inc., and Manager entered into that certain Sagebrush Management and Maintenance Agreement, dated as of September 1, 1989 (the ""Agreement"").

     B.  Concurrently herewith, all of the Partners are entering into a First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Sagebrush General Co-Ownership Partnership Agreement, by which the Partners agree, among other things, that Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. are admitted to the Partnership.

     C.  The Partnership, the Partners and Manager desire to amend the Agreement to extend the term of the Agreement and to add a new section concerning curtailment of the LIFO Partners (as defined below), all as set forth in this Amendment.

     NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the foregoing premises, the parties hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Amendment.           ---------

          (a)  Section 6.1 of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended by deleting the date ""September 30, 2003"" where it appears therein, and inserting in its place the date ""July 20, 2006"".

          (b)  A new Section 7.4 is hereby added to the Agreement, as follows:

               ""7.4 Disconnection of LIFO Partners. In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the ""LIFO Partners"") in the following circumstances.

If at any time, and for any reason other than force majeure affecting the Transmission Line, (i) the Transmission Line is incapable of delivering power at its designed capacity, availability or voltage and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would improve the capability of the transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed 1.14%, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Mariah, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Beta Mariah, Beta Mariah (Prime), or Gamma Mariah or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses for either of the power purchase contracts commonly known as Desert Winds I and Desert Winds III exceed the levels experienced immediately prior to the addition of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to the Transmission Line, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Joshua, Alpha Joshua (Prime), Beta Joshua, Beta Willow or Beta Willow (Prime) or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, then the Manager shall curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment. If the LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such priority. If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.""

          (c)  Existing Section 7.4 shall be renumbered as Section 7.5.





                                       2

          (d) All references in the Agreement to Manager as ""ToyoWest Management Company"" shall be interpreted as referring to ""ToyoWest Management Inc.,"" the correct name of Manager.

     2.  Continuing Validity. Except as expressly modified by Section 1 of this          ------------------- Amendment, all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. By execution of this Amendment, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. hereby become parties to the Agreement and agree to be bound by all of the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment.

     3.   Miscellaneous. The provisions contained in Article 10 of the Agreement           ------------- are hereby incorporated herein by this cross-reference.

RESTATED   NET INVESTMENT INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT   SECURIAN FUNDS TRUST

RESTATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT, effective as of May 1, 2012, by and between Advantus Capital  Management, Inc. (the ""Investment Adviser""), Securian Financial Services, Inc. (the ""Underwriter"") and Securian Funds Trust (the ""Trust""), a  Delaware statutory trust, on behalf of the Trust's Advantus Money Market Fund (the ""Fund"").

WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization approved by both the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Board of  Directors of Advantus Series Fund, Inc. (the ""Series Fund"") on July 28, 2011, and approved by a majority of the shareholders of each Portfolio of  the Series Fund on October 21, 2011, each Portfolio of the Series Fund was reorganized into a separate Fund of the Trust effective as of May 1,  2012; and

WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser, the Underwriter and the Series Fund have previously entered into a Net Investment Income  Maintenance Agreement, effective as of February 1, 2009 and an Amended and Restated Net Investment Income Maintenance Agreement  effective as of October 29, 2009 (the ""Prior Agreements""); and

WHEREAS, the parties have determined that each desires to restate and adopt the Prior Agreements as set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act""), as an open-end management  company of the series type, and the Fund is a series of the Trust; and

WHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the ""Advisory  Agreement""), pursuant to which the Investment Adviser will render investment advisory services to the Fund for compensation based on the  value of the average daily net assets of the Fund; and

WHEREAS, the Trust and the Underwriter have entered into an Underwriting and Distribution Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the  ""Underwriting Agreement"") pursuant to which the Underwriter acts the principal underwriter for the Fund, and receives compensation thereunder  pursuant to the Fund's Rule 12b-1 Plan; and

WHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have determined that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Fund and its  shareholders to maintain the Fund's daily ""Net Investment Income"" (as defined in paragraph 1.1 below) at or in excess of zero.





NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:











   2

1. Net Investment Income Maintenance.



1.1 Net Investment Income. ""Fund Investment Income"", as defined in paragraph 1.2 below, minus ""Fund Operating Expenses"" as defined  in paragraph 1.3 below equals Net Investment Income. If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment  Adviser shall waive its Advisory Fee or reimburse the Fund an amount (defined as ""Expense Waiver"") sufficient to produce a Net  Investment Income of zero.

  1.2 Fund Investment Income. Fund Investment Income includes interest and dividends, net of foreign withholding taxes, plus income from  securities lending activities, if applicable. Fund Investment Income does not include realized and unrealized gains or losses on  investments and foreign currencies.



1.3 Fund Operating Expenses. Fund Operating Expenses are the aggregate expenses of every character incurred by the Fund, including but  not limited to investment advisory fees of the Investment Adviser (but excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and other  expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and other extraordinary expenses not  incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund's business). Fund Operating Expenses do not include ""acquired fund fees and expenses""  as defined in SEC Form N-1A, as it may be amended from time to time.



1.4 Method of Computing Expense Waiver. To determine the Expense Waiver (Investment Adviser's liability), each day the Fund  Operating Expenses shall be subtracted from the Fund Investment Income to produce the daily Net Investment Income. If the daily Net  Investment Income is below zero for any day, the Investment Adviser shall first waive or reduce its advisory fee for such day by an  amount sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero. If the amount of the waived or reduced advisory fee for any such day is  insufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero , the Investment Adviser shall also pay Fund expenses or reimburse the Fund  an amount that, together with the waived or reduced advisory fee, is sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero.



1.5 Right of Recovery. The Investment Adviser shall have the option to recover the full amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense  Waiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeds zero. In no event, however, shall  the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day unless  the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case  such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable. If, and to  the extent, the payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser of the Expense Waiver would cause the Fund's Net Investment Income  to fall below zero, such payment shall be deferred until such date on which the











In connection with the obligation of the Investment Adviser to maintain the Fund's Net Investment Income as set forth in section 1 herein,  the Underwriter may waive its Rule 12b-1 fees contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, and shall have the same rights to be reimbursed  by the Fund as the Investment Adviser, as set forth in Section 1 herein, to the extent the Investment Adviser has not already been  reimbursed by the Fund for its payment of Rule 12b-1 fees.

This Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of one year from the date of its execution and from year to year thereafter provided such  continuance is specifically approved by a majority of the trustees of the Trust who (i) are not ""interested persons"" of the Trust or any other party  to this Agreement, as defined in the 1940 Act, and (ii) have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of this Agreement (""Non- Interested Trustees""). This Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement except the Investment Adviser's Right of  Recovery set forth in section 1.5 herein.



   3



payment would not cause the Fund to have a Net Investment Income of less than zero, provided that the right of the Investment  Adviser to receive such payment shall expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement.  For purposes of this paragraph 1.5 (and for purposes of paragraph 2), the Expense Waiver that may be recovered from the Fund shall  include the amount of any unrecovered Expense Waiver under the Prior Agreements, provided that the Investment Adviser's right to  receive such payment shall also expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement.



1.6 Payment. If the Investment Adviser is required to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser shall make such payment within 30 days  after each month-end in the amount due the Fund as of each month. If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense  Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end. Reimbursements to the Fund or the Expense Waiver  shall not include any additional charges or fees whatsoever, including, e.g., interest accruable on such reimbursements or the Expense  Waiver.

  1.7 Operating Expense Limit. Any Expense Waiver recovery payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser shall not cause the Operating  Expense for the Fund's full year of operations to exceed 1.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets.

Cerus Corporation - FIRST AMEND TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT.PDF,FIRST AMENDMENT TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT,"Cerus Corporation (""Cerus""); Porex Corporation (""Porex"")",6/22/18,04-01-2018,,,,,No,No,"[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. EXHIBIT 10.2 FIRST AMENDMENT TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT This First Amendment (""Amendment"") to the Supply and Manufacturing Agreement dated April 1, 2017 between Cerus Corporation (""Cerus"") and Porex Corporation (""Porex"") (the ""Agreement"") is made this 22 day of June 2018. RECITALS A. Cerus and Porex have agreed to make certain changes to the raw material and process to develop Components and such changes have resulted in a change to the cost and expense structure originally contemplated by the Agreement; B. Pursuant to Section 3 of the Agreement, Cerus and Porex have mutually agreed to temporarily modify the pricing for Platelet Wafers set forth on Exhibit D and to proactively set a cost structure for non-production related work. NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows: 1. New Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4, as set forth in Schedule 1 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the Agreement (inserted between Exhibit A-5 and Exhibit B-1) and incorporated therein by reference. The parties acknowledge and agree that Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4 set forth the revised specifications for Platelet Wafers manufactured by Porex for Cerus (collectively, the ""Revised Wafer Specifications""). Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Porex shall continue to manufacture and produce Platelet Wafers using the existing specifications for Platelet Wafers until Cerus gives written notice to Porex that Platelet Wafers shall be thereafter manufactured in accordance with the Revised Wafer Specifications. References in the Agreement to ""Specifications"" shall be interpreted to include the Revised Wafer Specifications, as applicable. 2. A new Exhibit D-1, as set forth in Schedule 2 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the Agreement and incorporated therein by reference. As of April 1, 2018 and continuing until Cerus determines, in its sole discretion, that the Protocol EPP-029-886 under which Porex is currently operating can be discontinued, the price for Platelet Wafers shall be the prices set forth in Exhibit D-1. Upon Cerus' determination that the Protocol EPP-029- 886 can be discontinued, Cerus shall provide written notice thereof to Porex, along with a new purchase order for Platelet Wafers (the ""New Pricing PO""). On and after the date of such notice, the ""Pricing"" table for Platelet Wafers in Exhibit D, as of the date immediately preceding the date of this Amendment, shall be reinstated and apply to Platelet Wafers that are produced pursuant to the New Pricing PO and were also produced after the date of the written notice. References in Section 1.5.1 of the Agreement to ""Exhibit D"" shall be amended to include ""Exhibit D-1,"" as applicable. 3. The penultimate sentence in Section 1.3 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: ""In no event shall any Purchase Order: require delivery of more than [*] units of [*] and [*] units of [*] in any [*] (the ""Porex Capacity Limitations"")."" 4. A new Section 1.5.3 shall be added to the Agreement as follows:





1.5.3 Porex will invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed by Porex during the prior month. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.

Cerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus. For disputed invoices or the disputed portion of an invoice, Cerus shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Porex, in writing, within [*] days, a description of the disputed amounts. Cerus and Porex shall negotiate in a timely, good faith manner to resolve billing queries. Cerus will not have responsibility to pay for identified errors, incomplete or inaccurate items (collectively the ""invoice errors"") which result in increases to previously invoiced amounts if the aforementioned invoice errors are communicated to Cerus later than [*] days from the original invoice date.

5. A new Section 3a shall be added to the Agreement as follows: ""3a Non-Production Related Work. From time to time, Cerus may submit to Porex written work orders substantially in the form of Schedule 3 that specify development activities, engineering analysis, part, material and/or fixture design and development, or other services or activities that Cerus requests Porex to perform that are not activities or services that are necessary for the then-current manufacture and production of Components for Cerus under the Agreement (collectively, as defined in each work order, the ""Services""). Each work order shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services. Upon acceptance of a work order by Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a ""Statement of Work."" If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement."" 6. A new section titled ""Pricing for Non-Production Related Work Orders from Cerus"" is added to Exhibit D as set forth in Schedule 2 attached. Such pricing, upon mutual agreement of the Parties, shall apply to any Statement of Work mutually agreed by the Parties pursuant to Section 3a. 7. No other changes are made to the Agreement, including without limitation, the original Exhibit D, and the Agreement, the Plasma Disk pricing and related information as set forth in Exhibit D remain the same. Except as amended herein, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this First Amendment to be signed, all as of the date first written above.

Specific information disclosed as part of the Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be in the public domain or in the prior possession of Consultant merely because it is encompassed or contemplated by more general information in the public domain or in the prior possession of the Consultant. Failure to mark any of the Confidential Information as confidential or proprietary shall not affect its status as Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement.





(b) Consultant shall keep all Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant shall not disclose, disseminate, publish, reproduce or use Confidential Information except to perform the Services. If Consultant is required by judicial or administrative process to disclose Confidential Information, Consultant shall promptly notify Aduro to allow Aduro a reasonable time to oppose such process and Consultant shall reasonably cooperate in Aduro's efforts.

(c) On Aduro's request, or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant shall immediately: (i) stop using Confidential Information; (ii) return all materials provided by Aduro to Consultant that contain Confidential Information, except for one copy that may be retained by Consultant's legal counsel to confirm compliance with the obligations under this Agreement; (iii) destroy all copies of Confidential Information in any form including Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus or materials prepared by or for Consultant; and (iv) provide a written warranty to Aduro that Consultant has taken all the actions described in the foregoing Subparagraphs 4(c)(i-iii).

(e) Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice: Nothing herein shall prevent Consultant from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation. Consultant does not need the prior authorization of Aduro to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify Aduro that it has made such reports or disclosures. In addition, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. §1833(b), Consultant shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and that is made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.

5. Independent Contractor. Consultant's relationship to Aduro shall be that of an independent contractor. Consultant shall be responsible for the timely payment of his or her own self-employment and income taxes. Neither party shall have any authority to bind the other.

Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (""Aduro IP""), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.





7. Nonsolicitation. From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the ""Restricted Period""), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief.

(d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not, directly or indirectly (whether for compensation or without compensation) engage in or provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof. If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the Company's General Counsel, Consultant will recuse herself from providing Services for the duration of the conflict.

9. Material Non-Public Information. Consultant may have access to, or learn, ""material non-public information"" about Aduro or companies working with Aduro during the course of performing Services under this Agreement.

10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflict of law principles of California or any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them with respect to the subject matter hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not supersede or in modify in anyway any other written agreement between the parties. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing signed by both of the parties hereto. The obligations of Consultant as set forth herein, other than Consultant's obligations to perform the Project, shall survive the termination of Consultant's engagement with Aduro. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain effective and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Consultant. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement.

                                BACKGROUND

      HPS (or one of its affiliates other than SHPS) provides certain administrative services and Care Management Services (as defined below) to clients (""Clients"") pursuant to the terms of agreements with such Clients (the ""Client Agreements"") as of January 1, 1998. HPS desires that SHPS provide, and SHPS is willing to provide, the Care Management Services to the Clients on behalf of HPS in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, the parties agree as follows:

                                   TERMS

      1.       SERVICES PROVIDED; TERM AND TERMINATION

               1.1 AGREEMENT TO OUTSOURCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. HPS agrees to outsource to SHPS, and hereby appoints SHPS as the exclusive provider of, Care Management Services to the Clients, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. SHPS shall provide the Care Management Services directly to the Clients in accordance with the terms of the Client Agreements. ""Care Management Services"" means the business of providing utilization review (which includes, but is not limited to, pre-admission certification, prior authorization, prospective length of stay approvals, second opinions, concurrent review and discharge planning), catastrophic medical case management, disease management and demand management (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) services to benefits payors and health providers, in all cases in accordance with the terms of the applicable Client Agreement.

               1.2 TERM. The term of this Agreement will commence on January 1, 1998 (the ""Effective Date"") and will end on December 31, 1998. Unless either party gives the other at least ninety days' prior written notice that it has elected not to extend the term of this Agreement beyond December 31, 1998, the term of this Agreement will be automatically extended until December 31, 1999. Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year.

               1.3 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. In the event that either party materially or repeatedly defaults in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder and does not substantially cure such default within thirty days after being given written notice specifying the default, or, with respect to those defaults which cannot reasonably be cured within thirty days, if the defaulting party fails to proceed promptly after being given such notice to commence curing the default and thereafter to reasonably proceed to cure the same, then the party not in default

2

may, by giving written notice to the defaulting party, terminate this Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination.

      2.       PAYMENTS

               2.1 FEES FOR CURRENT HPS CLIENTS. For each month during the term of this Agreement, HPS will pay to SHPS an amount equal to (i) eighty-two and one-half percent (82.5%) of the first $500,000 of Care Management Revenues (as defined below) during such month plus (ii) eighty percent (80%) of Care Management Revenues during such month in excess of $500,000. HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of the applicable month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.1 and Care Management Revenues by Client.

""Care Management Revenues"" means, with respect to any month during the term, the revenues collected by HPS from Clients (or new Clients, as applicable) for the Care Management Services. Monthly revenues for Care Management Services shall be calculated based on a per employee per month fee equal to: (i) the amount (as of the date of this Agreement) set forth in the applicable Client Agreement (including hourly medical case management fees); or (ii) if the Client Agreement does not include a per employee per month fee for Care Management Services, $2.00 (this amount shall apply to all individual and small group business). Prospectively, for new Clients, SHPS and HPS shall agree to the rate HPS will offer to such new Clients (including hourly medical case management fees).

               2.3 ALLOCATION OF COSTS. SHPS shall pay to HPS its allocable portion (which portion shall approximate HPS' direct costs chargeable to the business function) of depreciation, information system services, rent and utilities for the use by SHPS of HPS facilities in connection with its delivery of Care Management Services to the Clients. SHPS shall also reimburse HPS for direct costs for postage and telecommunications incurred by HPS in connection with such use by SHPS of HPS facilities. For convenience, the parties





acknowledge that HPS will deduct amounts owed by SHPS under this Section 2.3 from the fees described in Section 2.1 and reflect such deductions in the schedule prepared by HPS.

               2.4 NEW CLIENTS. In the event that HPS (or one of its affiliates other than SHPS) enters into an agreement to provide Care Management Services with a client which is not a Client as of the date of this Agreement (a ""New Client""), SHPS shall provide such Care Management Services to the New Client in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. HPS will pay to SHPS all Care Management Revenues collected from such New Client, and SHPS will pay a commission to HPS equal to five percent (5%) of such amount received by SHPS from HPS pursuant to this Section 2.4. HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of each month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.4 and Care

Management Revenues by New Client. For convenience, the parties acknowledge that HPS will deduct amounts owed by SHPS under this Section 2.4 from the amounts owed by HPS under this Section 2.4 and reflect such deductions in the schedule prepared by HPS.

               2.5 REPORTS; AUDIT RIGHTS. For the purpose of determining the fees payable to SHPS under this Agreement, HPS shall preserve adequate records of Care Management Revenues by Client. SHPS shall have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice, to examine, copy and audit such records. Such audit shall be conducted at the location where such records are maintained and shall be at the expense of SHPS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any audit reveal that additional payments to SHPS are due which exceed five percent (5%) of the amount paid to SHPS for the period under audit, HPS shall pay SHPS on demand for the cost of such audit.

      3. INDEMNIFICATION. Each party agrees to defend, save and hold harmless the other from and against all suits and claims that may be based on any injury to any person (including death) or to the property of any person or entity arising out of the operations of the indemnifying party or any willful act, negligence or omission of any of the indemnifying party's agents, servants or employees, provided that the indemnified party shall give notice promptly in writing of any suit or claim to the other party and that the indemnified party and its agents, servants and employees shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party and its counsel.

The Parties also declare that they are not making any      agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this      Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation      of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business      for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with      each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the      performance of their joint venture business operation.

11.  Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to      the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint      Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers      ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set      forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.

No Joint      Venturer shall be authorized or empowered to mortgage, hypothecate, pledge,      sell, or transfer, an interest in the Joint Venture, nor confer on any      successor or assignee the right to become a Joint Venturer without the      consent of the other Joint Venturer.

13.  Notice. Any notice which a Joint Venturer shall have occasion to give to      the other Joint Venturer shall be deemed sufficient notice for all purposes      as to its contents if given in writing, hand delivered, by fax, or prepaid      mail, to the address of such Joint Venturer as set out below his signature.

The Joint Venturers declare that in entering into this      Agreement, they have contracted with reference to the laws of the      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the construction and interpretation of      the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and      construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, except in      such cases and to such extent as the laws of another jurisdiction shall      necessarily control.

In the event  either  party is required to institute          litigation to enforce any provision of this  Agreement,  the prevailing          party in such  litigation  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  all  costs          including without limitation,  reasonable  attorney's fees and expenses          incurred in connection with such enforcement and collection.

the cooperation and provision of information to TKCI by Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman for SIC. In the event that information is required, it shall be provided in writing.

SIC, represented by Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman, will assist in the closing of the transactions by: 1) participating in meetings with key decision makers, providing process overview, and describing case histories of similarly situated projects; and 2) providing advice on issues such as i) location; (ii) deal structure; (iii) funding; (iv) timing/phasing; (v) cash flow/revenue collection issues; and (vi) other major implementation issues.

SIC shall allow TKCI to review and analyze all business opportunities that could be mutually beneficial to TKCI and SIC within the time frame of this alliance.

SIC, represented by Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman, will assist in the finalization of project structuring plans geared toward maximizing all available revenue streams.

SIC, represented by Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman, will provide access to other opportunities.

The decision to join this alliance is at the absolute discretion of Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman. TKCI affirms that it shall not have any claim towards SIC if the management decides not to sign the agreement in the investigation stage, and before any agreements are signed, for any reasons whatsoever.

SIC may try to locate, or authorize others to locate potential investors who are not Reserved Investors (or Rejected Investors), and SIC may accept investments from such other investors, without incurring any liability towards TKCI

Fees and Financial Structuring

A wholly-owned subsidiary (the ""Holding Company"") shall be established by TKCI to accomplish the following:

To hold the assets and liabilities of the TKCI/SIC alliance and provide for separate management of the alliance business operations.

Operating capital may be raised and a growing shareholder base may be established to support future expansion.

Net revenue from business operations created by Holding Company for the alliance will be distributed by Holding Company equally - 50/50 - to TKCI and SIC:

SIC's original business concepts and plans, as well as opportunities brought to the table through its connections, and third-party contracts, are ways that we anticipate business could be generated, and revenues created; TKCI's advisory and management services and capital resources will provide the critical structure and business mechanism to carry concepts through to revenue. Turnkey Capital Inc. (TKCI) will reserve ten percent (10%) of the shares of TKCI for SIC. These shares will be issued once an exclusivity agreement is reached. Once the Holding Company is raising funds and generating revenue, the parties will negotiate a monthly fee.

Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore's acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall confirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor.

2. Purchase Order Rescheduling, Cancellation and Modification. Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order.

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, dated as of January 1, 2004, that FEDERATED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY, a statutory trust duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the ""Adviser""), does hereby nominate, constitute and appoint FEDERATED ADVISORY SERVICES COMPANY, a statutory trust duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (""FASC""), to act hereunder as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the Adviser, acting on behalf of each of the funds or accounts for which Adviser acts as investment adviser or subadviser shown on Schedule 1 attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein (each such fund or account being hereinafter referred to as a ""Fund"" and collectively as the ""Funds""), for the specific purpose of executing and delivering all such agreements, instruments, contracts, assignments, bond powers, stock powers, transfer instructions, receipts, waivers, consents and other documents, and performing all such acts, as Adviser, or FASC acting as agent for the Adviser pursuant to the Services Agreement dated as of January 1, 2004 between the Adviser and FASC (such agreement, as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time is hereinafter referred to as the ""Services Agreement""), may deem necessary or reasonably desirable, related to the acquisition, disposition and/or reinvestment of the funds and assets of a Fund in accordance with Adviser's supervision of the investment, sale and reinvestment of the funds and assets of each Fund pursuant to the authority granted to the Adviser as investment adviser or subadviser of each Fund under the Adviser's investment advisory or subadvisory contract for such Fund (such investment advisory or subadvisory contract, as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time is hereinafter referred to as the ""Investment Advisory Contract"").

The Adviser hereby ratifies and confirms as good and effectual, at law or in equity, all that FASC, and its officers and employees, may do by virtue hereof. However, despite the above provisions, nothing herein shall be construed as imposing a duty on FASC to act or assume responsibility for any matters referred to above or other matters even though FASC may have power or authority hereunder to do so. Nothing in this Limited Power of Attorney shall be construed (i) to be an amendment or modifications of, or supplement to, the Investment Advisory Contract, (ii) to amend, modify, limit or denigrate any duties, obligations or liabilities of the Adviser under the terms of the Investment Advisory Contract or (iii) exonerate, relieve or release the Adviser from any losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Adviser (x) under the terms of the Investment Advisory Contract or (y) at law, or in equity, for the performance of its duties as the investment adviser or subadviser of any of the Funds.

The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an ""Indemnified Party"" and collectively the ""Indemnified Parties"") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.

Any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact hereunder for the Adviser on behalf of any Fund is hereby expressly put on notice that FASC is acting solely in the capacity as an agent of the Adviser as agent for the Fund and that any such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity must look solely to the Fund in question for enforcement of any claim against the Fund, as FASC assumes no personal liability whatsoever for obligations of the Fund entered into by FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for the Adviser.

Each person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity which deals with a Fund through FASC in its capacity as agent and attorney-in-fact of the Adviser, is hereby expressly put on notice (i) that all persons or entities dealing with the Fund must look solely to the assets of the Fund on whose behalf FASC is acting pursuant to its powers hereunder for enforcement of any claim against the Fund, as the trustees, officers and/or agents of such Fund, the shareholders of the various classes of shares of the Fund, and the other Funds of the trust or corporation of which a Fund may be a series, assume no personal liability whatsoever for obligations entered into on behalf of such Fund, and (ii) that the rights, liabilities and obligations of any one Fund are separate and distinct from those of any other Fund.

The execution of this Limited Power of Attorney by the Adviser acting on behalf of the several Funds shall not be deemed to evidence the existence of any express or implied joint undertaking or appointment by and among any or all of the Funds. Liability for or recourse under or upon any undertaking of FASC pursuant to the power or authority granted to FASC under this Limited Power of Attorney under any rule of law, statute or constitution or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or by legal or equitable proceedings or otherwise shall be limited only to the assets of the Fund on whose behalf FASC was acting pursuant to the authority granted hereunder.

The Adviser hereby agrees that no person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC shall be bound to inquire into FASC's power and authority hereunder and any such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity shall be fully protected in relying on such power or authority unless such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity has received prior





written notice from the Adviser that this Limited Power of Attorney has been revoked. This Limited Power of Attorney shall be revoked and terminated automatically upon the cancellation or termination of the Services Agreement or as to any Fund upon the cancellation or termination of the Adviser's Investment Advisory Contract for such Fund. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or terminated by the Adviser at any time provided that no such revocation or termination shall be effective until FASC has received actual notice of such revocation or termination in writing from the Adviser.

This Limited Power of Attorney constitutes the entire agreement between the Adviser and FASC and may be changed only by a writing signed by both of them, except that the Adviser may at any time change the list of Funds to which this Limited Power of Attorney relates by executing and delivering to FASC a later dated version of Schedule 1. This Limited Power of Attorney shall bind and benefit the respective successors and assigns of the Adviser and FASC; provided, however, that FASC shall have no power or authority hereunder to appoint a successor or substitute attorney in fact for the Adviser or any Fund.

This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without reference to principles of conflicts of laws. If any provision hereof, or any power or authority conferred upon FASC herein, would be invalid or unexercisable under applicable law, then such provision, power or authority shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to render it valid or exercisable while most nearly preserving its original intent, and no provision hereof, or power or authority conferred upon FASC herein, shall be affected by the invalidity or the non-exercisability of another provision hereof, or of another power or authority conferred herein.

This Limited Power of Attorney may be executed in as many identical counterparts as may be convenient and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts. This Limited Power of Attorney shall become binding on the Adviser when the Adviser shall have executed at least one counterpart and FASC shall have accepted its appointment by executing this Limited Power of Attorney. Immediately after the execution of a counterpart original of this Limited Power of Attorney and solely for the convenience of the parties hereto, the Adviser and FASC will execute sufficient counterparts so that FASC shall have a counterpart executed by it and the Adviser, and the Adviser shall have a counterpart executed by the Adviser and FASC. Each counterpart shall be deemed an original and all such taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument, and it shall not be necessary in making proof of this Limited Power of Attorney to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.





IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Adviser has caused this Limited Power of Attorney to be executed by its duly authorized officer as of the date first written above.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  1.   Capital Contributions. In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital for each of the Company's first and third fiscal quarters (as determined based on the Company's first and third fiscal quarterly filed statutory financial statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance department or the Company's independent auditors) falls below the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action Level RBC (in each case as estimated by the Company as of the end of each such first and third fiscal quarters, as the case may be, taking into account (for purposes of such estimation) facts and circumstances occurring after the end of such fiscal quarter but before such time as AIG would be obligated pursuant to paragraph 3 to make a contribution), AIG shall, within the respective time periods set forth under paragraph 3, in accordance with paragraph 4 and in compliance with applicable law, provide to the Company cash, cash equivalents, securities or other







      instruments that qualify (as admitted assets) for purposes of calculating the Company's Total Adjusted Capital, as a contribution and not as a loan, in an amount such that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital as of the end of each of the Company's second and fourth fiscal quarter, as the case may be, will be projected to be at least equal to the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action Level RBC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AIG may, at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable law, make a contribution to the Company in such amount as is required for the Company's Total Adjusted Capital to equal a percentage of its Company Action Level RBC determined to be appropriate by the Company and AIG.

  2.   Defined Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms ""Total Adjusted Capital"" and ""Company Action Level RBC"" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto under the insurance laws and regulations of the Domiciliary State, or, if not defined therein, shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (""RBC"") instructions promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (""NAIC""). The term ""Specified Minimum Percentage"" shall be equal to the percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon the date of the filing of the Company's 2014 Annual Statement with the Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against the capital adequacy standards and criteria (""Agency Criteria"") of each of Standard & Poor's Corp. (""S&P""), Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") and A.M. Best Company (""A.M. Best""). Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1 may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State.

  4.   Funding Mechanics. At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 3, AIG agrees that it will either (a) make such contribution to the Company's direct parent and cause such direct parent to then contribute such funds, securities or instruments so contributed by AIG to the Company, or (b) make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor. All contributions contemplated under this Agreement shall be approved and made in compliance with applicable law, including, without limitation, approval by the board of directors of each applicable entity and any prior notice or approval requirements specified under applicable rules and regulations.

  5.   AIG Policies.

3







      corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer, in each case, (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M.

To the extent not terminated previously by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 7 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains outstanding as of, the Termination Date.

  8.   Policyholder Rights. Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that no policyholder of the Company may take any action authorized under this paragraph 8 unless and until (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 8, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and, provided, further, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 7 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for under this paragraph 8 shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to, and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 8).

Except as set forth below, the Adviser will pay all operating expenses of each Fund specifically assumed by the Fund under the Management Agreement between the Trust and the Adviser dated June 24, 2020 (the ""Management Agreement""), including without limitation the compensation and expenses of any employees of the Fund and of any other persons rendering any services to the Fund; clerical and shareholder service staff salaries; office space and other office expenses; fees and expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with membership in investment company organizations; legal, auditing and accounting expenses; expenses of registering shares under federal and state securities laws, including expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with the organization and initial registration of shares of the Fund; insurance expenses; fees and expenses of the custodian, transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, shareholder service agent, plan agent, administrator (excluding fees and expenses payable to the Adviser under this Agreement and the Management Agreement), accounting and pricing services agent and underwriter of the Fund; expenses, including clerical expenses, of issue, sale, redemption or repurchase of shares of the Fund; the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the cost of printing or preparing prospectuses and statements of additional information for delivery to shareholders; the cost of printing or preparing stock certificates or any other documents, statements or reports to shareholders; expenses of shareholders' meetings and proxy solicitations; and all other operating expenses not specifically assumed by the Fund.

The Fund will pay all brokerage fees and commissions, taxes, borrowing costs (such as (a) interest and (b) dividend expenses on securities sold short), ADR fees, fees and expenses of acquired funds, extraordinary or non-recurring expenses as may arise, including litigation to which the Fund may be a party and indemnification of the Trust's Trustees and officers with respect thereto.

2

be part of the Adviser's compensation pursuant to this Agreement.





4. Record Keeping and Other Information. The Adviser shall create and maintain all necessary records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, records required by Section 31(a) of the Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the various functions performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party pursuant to contract with the Trust. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by the Adviser for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.

5. Audit, Inspection and Visitation. The Adviser shall make available to the Trust during regular business hours all records and other data created and maintained pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Agreement for reasonable audit and inspection by the Trust or any regulatory agency having authority over the Trust.

6. Compensation. For the performance of the Adviser's obligations under this Agreement, including payment of certain expenses of each of the Funds pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof, each Fund shall pay the Adviser, on the first business day following the end of each month, a fee at an annual rate of 0.65% of a Fund's average daily net assets up to $25 million, 0.35% of a Fund's average daily net assets from $25 million to $100 million, and 0.25% of a Fund's average daily net assets for such assets in excess of $100 million.

The average value of the daily net assets of a Fund shall be determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust or a resolution of the Board of Trustees, if required. If, pursuant to such provisions, the determination of net asset value of a Fund is suspended for any particular business day, then for the purposes of this paragraph, the value of the net assets of a Fund as last determined shall be deemed to be the value of the net assets as of the close of the business day, or as of such other time as the value of the Fund's net assets may lawfully be determined, on that day. If the determination of the net asset value of a Fund has been suspended for a period including such month, the Adviser's compensation payable at the end of such month shall be computed on the basis of the value of the net assets of the Fund as last determined (whether during or prior to such month).

7. Limitation of Liability. The Adviser may rely on information reasonably believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Except as may otherwise be required by the Act or the rules thereunder, neither the Adviser nor its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof (collectively, the ""Adviser Employees"") shall be subject to any liability for, or any damages, expenses or losses incurred by the Trust in connection with any error of judgment, mistake of law, any act or omission in connection with or arising out of any services rendered under or payments made pursuant to this Agreement or any other matter to which this Agreement relates, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of any such persons in the performance of the duties of the Adviser under this Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the obligations and duties of the Adviser under this Agreement. Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder or agent of the Adviser, who may be or become a trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the Trust or

3

acting on any business of the Trust (other than services or business in connection with the Adviser's duties hereunder), to be rendering such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director, officer, employee, shareholder or agent, or one under the control or direction of the Adviser, even though paid by it. The Adviser is responsible for any information that it provides to the Trust for inclusion in the prospectus and/or statement of additional information of the Fund. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from any inaccurate or incomplete statement provided by the Adviser (or its officers, employees, directors and agents) for inclusion in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from your willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Agreement.

8. Services for Others. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Adviser or any affiliated person of the Adviser from providing services for any other person, firm or corporation, including other investment companies; provided, however, that the Adviser expressly represents that it will undertake no activities which, in its judgment, will adversely affect the performance of its obligations to the Trust under this Agreement.

9. Renewal and Termination. The term of this Services Agreement shall begin on the date of execution and shall continue in effect for a period of two years. This Services Agreement shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter, subject to termination as hereinafter provided, if such continuance is approved at least annually by vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust or the Adviser. This Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by either party upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser such compensation as may be payable for the period prior to the effective date of such termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the Management Agreement is assigned or otherwise terminated.

10. The Trust. The term ""PFS Funds"" means and refers to the Trustees from time to time serving under the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust as the same may subsequently thereto have been, or subsequently hereto may be, amended. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trust hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the Trustees, officers, employees, agents or nominees of the Trust, or any shareholders of any series of the Trust, personally, but bind only the trust property of the Trust (and only the property of the Fund). The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees of the Trust and signed by an officer of the Trust, acting as such, and neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind only the trust property of the Trust (and only the property of the Fund) as provided in its Agreement and Declaration of Trust. A copy of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust is on file with the Secretary of State of Massachusetts.

Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors,  agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the  Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

The only rights granted to the Sponsor hereunder are the right to receive the Benefits, and Racing hereby retains all  other rights with respect to the Racing Team, including but not limited to logos, symbols, names and other marks and intellectual property of the  Racing Team, and any proceeds derived by the Racing Team. The Sponsor hereby retains and does not grant any rights to Racing to use any of its  logos, symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property, except for use as described in Section 2 hereof. In the event that this Agreement is  terminated or if the sponsorship terminates at the end of the term provided for herein, each of the parties shall retain the rights to use its logos,  symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property including, in the case of the Sponsor, the right to use the names and marks ""GAINSCO 99"",  ""the GAINSCO 99 Car"", or similar phrases or derivations thereof.

Racing agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, (i) Sponsor shall have the right to approve or disapprove any  additional sponsor identified by Racing, and (ii) unless another proposed sponsor has agreed to pay a sponsorship fee that exceeds the amount  paid by Sponsor, no other sponsor shall receive any benefit of greater value (including either an equivalent or a more prominent use of another  sponsor's name, logo or other identifying information) than the Benefits provided to the Sponsor hereunder.

8. Insurance.   (a) Racing shall obtain and maintain, at Racing's expense, comprehensive automobile liability insurance covering all owned, non-owned and  hired vehicles used by Racing in the Business with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence combined single limit for personal injury and  property damage, including all statutory coverage for all states of operation. Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision  insurance on each vehicle used in the Business. Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing ""Gainsco Inc. and all  related entities"" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the  Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.

If Racing's liability policies do not contain the standard separation of insureds provision, or a substantially similar clause, they  shall be endorsed to provide cross-liability coverage.

(c) Racing shall provide the Sponsor with a certificate of insurance evidence compliance with the insurance requirements set forth above.  Certificates shall provide that ""Gainsco Inc. and all related entities"" shall be named as additional insureds on all liability policies, stating that such  insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available to the Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days' prior  written notice to the Sponsor of termination, cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.

(d) Such certificates shall be in a form acceptable to, and underwritten by insurance company(ies) reasonably satisfactory to the Sponsor. By  requiring insurance herein, the Sponsor does not represent that coverage limits will necessarily be adequate to protect Racing.

Upon termination, the Sponsor shall be entitled  to a pro rata refund of monies paid for services not yet performed by Racing based upon the number of races for the applicable racing season.

     (c) During the 30 days immediately preceding the Effective Time of the    Merger, the undersigned has not sold, transfered, or otherwise disposed of    his interests in, or reduced his risk relative to, any of the shares of GSMS    Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned as of the record date for    determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting    of GSMS held to approve the Merger.

     (d) The undersigned is aware that PSS intends to treat the Merger as a tax-    free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code (""Code"")





   for federal income tax purposes.  The undersigned agrees to treat the    transaction in the same manner as PSS for federal income tax purposes.  The    undersigned acknowledges that Section 1.368-1(b) of the Income Tax    Regulations requires ""continuity of interest"" in order for the Merger to be    treated as tax-free under Section 368 of the Code. This requirement is    satisfied if, taking into account those GSMS shareholders who receive cash in    exchange for their stock, who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, or    who dissent from the Merger, there is no plan or intention on the part of the    GSMS shareholders to sell or otherwise dispose of the PSS Common Stock to be    received in the Merger that will reduce such shareholders' ownership to a    number of shares having, in the aggregate, a value at the time of the Merger    of less than 50% of the total fair market value of the GSMS Common Stock    outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The undersigned has no    prearrangement, plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an amount    of his PSS Common Stock to be received in the Merger which would cause the    foregoing requirement not to be satisfied.

     4.  Restrictions on Transfer.  The undersigned understands and agrees that          ------------------------                                               stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares of PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be given to PSS's transfer agent and that there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or shares issued in substitution thereof, a legend stating in substance:

   ""The shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a    business combination which is accounted for as a ""pooling of interests"" and    may not be sold, nor may the owner thereof reduce his risks relative thereto    in any way, until such time as PSS, Inc. (""PSS"") has published the financial    results covering at least 30 days of combined operations after the effective    date of the merger through which the business combination was effected.  In    addition, the shares represented by this certificate may not be sold,    transferred or otherwise disposed of except or unless (1) covered by an    effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as    amended, (2) in accordance with (i) Rule 145(d) (in the case of shares issued    to an individual who is not an affiliate of PSS) or (ii) Rule 144 (in the                            ---                                                  case of shares issued to an individual who is an affiliate of PSS) of the    Rules and Regulations of such Act, or (3) in accordance with a legal opinion    satisfactory to counsel for PSS that such sale or transfer is otherwise    exempt from the registration requirements of such Act.""

Such legend will also be placed on any certificate representing PSS securities issued subsequent to the original issuance of the PSS Common Stock pursuant to the Merger as a result of any transfer of such shares or any stock dividend, stock split, or other recapitalization as long as the PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger has not been transferred in such manner to justify the removal of the legend therefrom.  Upon the request of the undersigned, PSS shall cause the certificates representing the shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any legend relating to restrictions on transfer by virtue of ASR 130 and 135 as soon as practicable after the requirements of ASR 130 and 135 have been met.  In addition, if the provisions of Rules 144 and 145 are amended to eliminate restrictions applicable to the PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger, or at the expiration of the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d), PSS, upon the request of the undersigned, will cause the certificates representing the shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any legend relating to the restrictions set forth in Rules 144 and 145(d) upon receipt by PSS of an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such legend may be removed.

                                     - 2 -

       5.  Understanding of Restrictions on Dispositions.  The undersigned has          ---------------------------------------------                       carefully read the Agreement and this Affiliate Agreement and discussed their requirements and impact upon his ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned, to the extent he believes necessary, with his counsel or counsel for GSMS.

     6.  Filing of Reports by PSS.  PSS agrees, for a period of three years          ------------------------                                           after the effective date of the Merger, to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that the public information provisions of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the SEC as the same are presently in effect will be available to the undersigned in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger.

     7.  Transfer Under Rule 145(d).  If the undersigned desires to sell or          --------------------------                                         otherwise transfer the shares of PSS Common Stock received by him in connection with the Merger at any time during the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d), the undersigned will provide the necessary representation letter to the transfer agent for PSS Common Stock together with such additional information as the transfer agent may reasonably request.  If PSS's counsel concludes that such proposed sale or transfer complies with the requirements of Rule 145(d), PSS shall cause such counsel to provide such opinions as may be necessary to PSS's Transfer Agent so that the undersigned may complete the proposed sale or transfer.

     8.  Acknowledgments.  The undersigned recognizes and agrees that the          ---------------                                                  foregoing provisions also apply to all shares of the capital stock of GSMS and PSS that are deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal securities laws, which the undersigned agrees may include,





without limitation, shares owned or held in the name of (i) the undersigned's spouse, (ii) any relative of the undersigned or of the undersigned's spouse who has the same home as the undersigned, (iii) any trust or estate in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse, and any such relative collectively own at least a 10% beneficial interest or of which any of the foregoing serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar capacity, and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse and any such relative collectively own at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest.  The undersigned further recognizes that, in the event that the undersigned is a director or officer of PSS or becomes a director or officer of PSS upon consummation of the Merger, among other things, any sale of PSS Common Stock by the undersigned within a period of less than six months following the effective time of the Merger may subject the undersigned to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

     9.  Miscellaneous.  This Affiliate Agreement is the complete agreement          -------------                                                      between PSS and the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof.  Any notice required to be sent to any party hereunder shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, using the addresses set forth herein or such other address as shall be furnished in writing by the parties.  This Affiliate Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
